## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Run Seed Scripts** ⏳

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd D:\fx-platform-windows-fresh

# Seed weekday strategy
npx tsx scripts/seed-default-strategy.ts

# Expected output:
# 🌱 Seeding default strategy template...
# ✅ Found user: admin@example.com
# ✅ Default strategy created successfully!

# Seed weekend strategy
npx tsx scripts/seed-weekend-strategy.ts

# Expected output:
# 🌙 Seeding weekend strategy template...
# ✅ Found user: admin@example.com
# ✅ Weekend strategy created successfully!
```

---

### **Step 2: Verify in Database** ⏳

```sql
-- Check both strategies created
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  symbol,
  timeframe,
  status,
  "isPublic",
  "createdAt"
FROM "Strategy"
WHERE name LIKE '%Default%' OR name LIKE '%Weekend%'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

-- Expected results:
-- 1. RSI Mean Reversion (Default Template) | EURUSD | H1 | draft | true
-- 2. Weekend Crypto Breakout (BTCUSD) | BTCUSD | H1 | draft | true
```

---

### **Step 3: Test Strategies** ⏳

#### **Option A: Backtest First (Recommended)**

```bash
# Backtest weekday strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/backtest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "strategyId": "weekday-strategy-id",
    "symbol": "EURUSD",
    "timeframe": "H1",
    "startDate": "2024-07-01",
    "endDate": "2024-10-01",
    "initialBalance": 10000
  }'

# Backtest weekend strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/backtest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "strategyId": "weekend-strategy-id",
    "symbol": "BTCUSD",
    "timeframe": "H1",
    "startDate": "2024-07-01",
    "endDate": "2024-10-01",
    "initialBalance": 10000
  }'
```

#### **Option B: Live Test (Small Size)**

```bash
# Assign weekday strategy to executor
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/strategy/{weekday-id}/assignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "executorId": "executor-id",
    "settings": {
      "lotSize": 0.01,
      "maxPositions": 1,
      "maxDailyLoss": 100
    }
  }'

# Activate weekday strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/strategy/{weekday-id}/activate

# Same for weekend strategy...
```

---

### **Step 4: Monitor Performance** ⏳

#### **Week 1: Verify Signal Generation**

```sql
-- Check signals generated
SELECT 
  DATE("openTime") as date,
  COUNT(*) as signals,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "profit" > 0 THEN 1 END) as wins,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "profit" < 0 THEN 1 END) as losses,
  SUM("profit") as daily_pnl
FROM "Trade"
WHERE "strategyId" IN ('weekday-id', 'weekend-id')
GROUP BY DATE("openTime")
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Expected weekday: 2-5 signals per day
-- Expected weekend: 3-5 signals per weekend
```

#### **Week 2-4: Track Performance**

```sql
-- Full performance metrics
SELECT 
  s.name as strategy,
  COUNT(t.id) as total_trades,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN t."profit" > 0 THEN 1 END)::float / COUNT(t.id) * 100 as win_rate,
  AVG(CASE WHEN t."profit" > 0 THEN t."profit" END) as avg_win,
  AVG(CASE WHEN t."profit" < 0 THEN t."profit" END) as avg_loss,
  SUM(t."profit") as total_profit,
  MIN(t."profit") as largest_loss,
  MAX(t."profit") as largest_win
FROM "Trade" t
JOIN "Strategy" s ON t."strategyId" = s.id
WHERE s.name LIKE '%Default%' OR s.name LIKE '%Weekend%'
GROUP BY s.name;

-- Expected weekday win rate: 62-68%
-- Expected weekend win rate: 55-62%
```

---

### **Step 5: Optimize if Needed** ⏳

#### **If Win Rate Lower Than Expected:**

```typescript
// Tighten entry conditions
{
  "rsi_oversold": 25,  // Down from 30
  "rsi_overbought": 75, // Up from 70
  "stochastic_oversold": 15, // Down from 20
  "stochastic_overbought": 85  // Up from 80
}
```

#### **If Too Few Signals:**

```typescript
// Loosen entry conditions
{
  "rsi_oversold": 35,  // Up from 30
  "rsi_overbought": 65, // Down from 70
  "stochastic_oversold": 25, // Up from 20
  "stochastic_overbought": 75  // Down from 80
}
```

#### **If Drawdown Too High:**

```typescript
// Reduce risk
{
  "riskPercentage": 0.5, // Down from 1.0% (weekday)
  "riskPercentage": 0.25, // Down from 0.5% (weekend)
  "maxPositions": 2, // Down from 3 (weekday)
  "maxPositions": 1, // Down from 2 (weekend)
}
```
