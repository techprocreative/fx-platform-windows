# H4 Backtest Fix - 365 Days Support

## Problem
H4 (4-hour) timeframe was incorrectly limited to 60 days for backtesting, when it should support up to 365 days like 1h interval.

## Root Cause
Yahoo Finance API does NOT have native 4h interval support. Previously, the code was falling back to daily data (1d), which caused incorrect backtest results.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Frontend Validation** (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/backtest/page.tsx`)
- Removed H4 from 60-day limitation list
- Updated UI text to clarify: "15min and 30min intervals are limited to 60 days, while 1h and 4h intervals support up to 365 days"

### 2. **Data Provider** (`src/lib/data-providers/yahoo-finance/provider.ts`)
- **4h Aggregation Logic**: Fetch 1h data (4x more candles) and aggregate to 4h
- When user requests 4h data:
  - Request `limit * 4` of 1h candles from Yahoo Finance
  - Aggregate every 4 hourly candles into one 4h candle:
    - Open = first candle's open
    - High = max of 4 candles
    - Low = min of 4 candles
    - Close = last candle's close
    - Volume = sum of 4 candles
    - Timestamp = first candle's timestamp

### 3. **Aggregation Method**
```typescript
private aggregateTo4h(hourlyData: OHLCV[]): OHLCV[] {
  // Groups every 4 hourly candles into 4-hour blocks
  // Aligns to 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC
  for (let i = 0; i < hourlyData.length; i += 4) {
    const chunk = hourlyData.slice(i, i + 4);
    // Aggregate OHLCV data...
  }
}
```

## Results
✅ H4 backtests now support up to **365 days** of historical data  
✅ Proper 4-hour candles generated from 1h data  
✅ Build successful with no errors  
✅ Validation no longer blocks H4 with long date ranges  

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test H4 backtest with 180-day range (should work)
2. Test H4 backtest with 365-day range (should work)
3. Compare H4 results with MT4/MT5 H4 data for accuracy
4. Verify aggregation aligns to proper 4-hour blocks

## Toast Warning Fix

### Issue
User reported toast warning appearing when running backtest with 4h interval and >60 days range.

### Root Cause Found
Backend route (`src/app/api/backtest/route.ts`) had a warning that triggered for ALL intervals when period > 60 days:
```typescript
if (daysDiff > 60) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ WARNING: Long backtest period detected...`);
}
```

This warning was incorrectly applying to 4h interval which should support 365 days.

### Fix Applied
Updated backend validation to ONLY warn for intervals that are actually limited to 60 days:
```typescript
const limitedIntervals = ["1min", "5min", "15min", "30min"];
if (daysDiff > 60 && limitedIntervals.includes(interval)) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ WARNING: ${interval} limited to 60 days...`);
}
```

### Result
✅ No more warnings for 4h backtests with >60 day ranges  
✅ Warnings only appear for truly limited intervals (15min, 30min)  
✅ User experience improved for H4 backtesting
