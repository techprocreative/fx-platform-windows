### Configuration Updates
- Rate limiting tiers can be configured via existing rate limiter configuration
- Connection limits can be adjusted via WebSocket server configuration
- Market holidays can be updated via the MARKET_HOLIDAYS constant

### Monitoring Setup
- Error reporting endpoint: `/api/errors/report`
- Rate limiting headers are automatically added to all responses
- Memory usage is logged to console (can be integrated with monitoring systems)

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Memory Usage**: Should remain stable with < 1% growth over 24h
2. **Error Rates**: Should decrease due to better error handling and validation
3. **API Response Times**: Should improve with better resource management
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Should be properly limited and controlled
5. **Security Events**: Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Alerts to Configure
- Memory usage growth > 1% over 24h
- Error rate increase > 10%
- Concurrent backtest limit reached frequently
- Rate limiting violations
- Authentication failures

## Future Improvements

### Phase 2 Considerations
1. **Advanced Monitoring**: Integration with external monitoring services (Sentry, DataDog)
2. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Redis-based distributed rate limiting
3. **Advanced Market Data**: Real-time market calendar integration
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and query optimization
5. **Security Enhancements**: Advanced threat detection and response

### Technical Debt
- Consider migrating from in-memory to Redis-based locking for distributed deployments
- Enhance market calendar to support multiple exchanges
- Implement more sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
- Add performance benchmarking and monitoring
