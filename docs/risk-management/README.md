# Risk Management Documentation

## Overview

The FX Trading Platform implements a comprehensive risk management system designed to protect traders from excessive losses while optimizing trading performance. This multi-layered approach ensures that all trading activities adhere to strict risk parameters and provides multiple safety mechanisms to prevent catastrophic financial loss.

## Risk Management Philosophy

Our risk management approach is based on three core principles:

1. **Capital Preservation** - Protect trading capital above all else
2. **Consistent Risk** - Maintain consistent risk per trade regardless of market conditions
3. **Automated Enforcement** - Remove human emotion from risk decisions through automation

## Risk Management Components

### 1. Pre-Trade Risk Assessment
- Position size calculation based on account balance and risk percentage
- Stop loss validation and minimum distance requirements
- Market hours and liquidity checks
- Correlation analysis with existing positions
- Sector and currency exposure limits

### 2. Real-Time Risk Monitoring
- Continuous position monitoring and P&L tracking
- Dynamic risk exposure calculation
- Drawdown monitoring and alerts
- Margin requirement tracking
- Automated position closure on limit breaches

### 3. Post-Trade Risk Analysis
- Trade performance analysis
- Risk-adjusted return calculations
- Strategy risk profiling
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit trail generation

## Risk Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Hard Limits
These limits cannot be overridden and will prevent trade execution:

- Maximum risk per trade
- Maximum daily loss
- Maximum drawdown
- Maximum position count
- Minimum stop loss distance

### 2. Soft Limits
These limits generate warnings but allow execution with confirmation:

- High correlation between positions
- Approaching sector exposure limits
- Elevated market volatility
- Wide spreads

### 3. Dynamic Limits
These limits adjust based on market conditions:

- Position sizing based on volatility
- Risk percentage adjustment based on recent performance
- Leverage reduction during high volatility periods

## Risk Scoring System

Each trade is assigned a risk score from 1-10 based on:

- **Market Conditions** (30% weight)
  - Volatility levels
  - Liquidity conditions
  - Spread width
  - News events

- **Portfolio Impact** (40% weight)
  - Correlation with existing positions
  - Sector concentration
  - Currency exposure
  - Overall portfolio risk

- **Trade Parameters** (30% weight)
  - Risk/reward ratio
  - Stop loss distance
  - Position size relative to account
  - Leverage used

### Risk Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Risk Level | Action |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1-3 | Low | Auto-approve |
| 4-6 | Medium | Require confirmation |
| 7-8 | High | Require manual approval |
