#### Currency Pairs

- **Minor Pairs**: EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY
- **Exotic Pairs**: USD/TRY, USD/ZAR, USD/SGD

#### Bid and Ask Prices
- **Bid Price**: The price at which you can sell the base currency
- **Ask Price**: The price at which you can buy the base currency
- **Spread**: The difference between the bid and ask prices

#### Pips
A pip (percentage in point) is the smallest price move in a forex pair. For most pairs, a pip is the fourth decimal place (0.0001).

### Order Types

#### Limit Orders
Set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell.

#### Stop Orders
