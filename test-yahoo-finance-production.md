## 📊 Expected Results

### Scenario A: Yahoo Finance Working in Production

- Backtest should complete successfully

## 🔍 What to Check

### Yahoo Finance vs TwelveData Comparison
- Are trade counts different?
- Are return percentages different?
- Are win rates different?
- Is data availability different?

### Error Handling
- If Yahoo Finance fails, does it fallback gracefully?
- Are there any error messages visible to user?
- Does backtest complete successfully?

### Data Quality
- Are there any gaps in data?
- Are date ranges respected?
- Is data granularity appropriate?

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Yahoo Finance Returns Errors:
1. **Expected Behavior:** System should fallback to TwelveData automatically
2. **Check Logs:** Look for "Yahoo Finance failed, trying TwelveData..." messages
3. **User Impact:** Should be minimal - backtest should still complete

### If Results Are Identical:
1. **Check Data Source:** Make sure Yahoo Finance was actually selected
2. **Check Date Range:** Try different date ranges
3. **Check Symbol:** Yahoo Finance may have different symbol coverage

### If Backtest Fails Completely:
1. **Check Strategy:** Try with a different strategy
2. **Check Date Range:** Try shorter date ranges (30 days or less)
