==========================================================
WINDOWS EXECUTOR V2 - CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETE
==========================================================

Status: BETA READY (90%)
Date: October 27, 2025

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
=====================

1. SECURITY FIXES (CRITICAL)
   - CORS: Fixed - Only allows platform URL
   - Debug Mode: Disabled by default in production
   - Rate Limiting: 100 requests/60 seconds (production only)
   - Retry Mechanisms: All platform API calls with exponential backoff

2. DATABASE FIXES (CRITICAL)
   - DELETE Endpoint: /api/strategies/{id}/permanent
   - Batch DELETE: /api/strategies/batch
   - Properly deletes from database (not just stop)
   - Cleans up trade logs (foreign key)

3. ADVANCED FEATURES (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Advanced Risk Management:
     * Daily trade limits
     * Daily loss limits
     * Max drawdown protection
     * Per-symbol position limits
     * Correlation checks
     * Consecutive loss limits
   
   - Enhanced Partial Exits:
     * Profit-based triggers (pips/percentage/RR)
     * Trailing stop triggers
     * ATR-based triggers
     * Time-based triggers
     * Regime-based triggers
     * Price-based triggers
     * Multi-level configuration

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
- backend/main.py (CORS + rate limiting)
- backend/config.py (debug mode default)
- backend/api/strategies.py (DELETE endpoints)
- backend/core/platform_api.py (retry decorators)
- backend/core/__init__.py (import fixes)
- backend/database/__init__.py (import fixes)

FILES CREATED:
==============
- backend/middleware/rate_limiter.py
- backend/utils/retry.py
- backend/core/advanced_risk_manager.py
- backend/core/enhanced_partial_exits.py

REMAINING WORK:
===============
1. Integration into strategy_executor.py
2. Unit tests for new modules
3. Frontend UI updates for new features
4. Full rebuild and testing
5. Documentation updates

TESTING:
========
- Rate Limiting: OK
- Retry Utilities: OK
- Advanced Risk Manager: Needs integration
- Enhanced Partial Exits: Needs integration
- Import issues: Fixed in core/__init__.py and database/__init__.py

READY FOR:
==========
- Beta testing with 10-20 users
- Manual monitoring required
- Production in 1 week after integration
