## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### **Setup Flow:**
```
1. User creates executor on web platform
   → API generates 3 credentials:
      - API Key (exe_xxx)
      - API Secret
      - Shared Secret

2. User downloads Windows Executor installer

3. User runs Setup Wizard:
   Step 1: Auto-detect MT5
   Step 2: Enter credentials (4 fields)
      - Platform URL
      - API Key
      - API Secret
      - Shared Secret ← NEW!
   Step 3: Complete

4. Windows Executor starts:
   → MainController.initialize(config)
   → zeromqService.setSharedSecret(config.sharedSecret)
   → 🔐 Shared secret configured for MT5 EA authentication

5. Send command to MT5:
   → zeromqService.sendRequest({"command":"PING"})
   → Auto-inject: request.token = sharedSecret
   → {"command":"PING","token":"abc123..."}

6. MT5 EA receives:
   → ValidateToken(request)
   → token == InpSharedSecret ✅
   → Command executed
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **Issue 1: Authentication Blocked**
**Symptom:** MT5 EA shows "🚫 Authentication blocked due to multiple failures"

**Cause:** EA tracks failed auth attempts. After 5 failures → blocked for 5 minutes.

**Solution:**
1. Remove EA from chart
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Re-attach EA to chart
4. Ensure InpSharedSecret matches web platform
5. g_failedAuthCount resets to 0

### **Issue 2: Old Config With No Shared Secret**
**Symptom:** Windows Executor logs: "⚠️ No shared secret configured"

**Cause:** Config from before shared secret implementation.

**Solution:**
1. Run CLEAR_CONFIG.bat
2. Restart Windows Executor
3. Setup wizard appears
4. Enter ALL credentials including shared secret
5. Complete setup

### **Issue 3: Token Still Missing**
**Symptom:** Commands sent without token field

**Cause:** Windows Executor not restarted after config update.

**Solution:**
1. Close Windows Executor completely
2. Relaunch
3. Check logs for "🔐 Shared secret configured"
4. Token will now be included
