## üö® PROBLEM #1: ZeroMQ Connection Errors

### Details:
```
Error Message: "ZeroMQ not connected"
Service: MarketDataService
Function: Failed to get market data
Count: 16 errors
First Occurrence: 14:19:11
Last Occurrence: 14:22:56
```

### Timeline:
```

14:19:26 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:19:41 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:19:56 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:20:11 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:20:26 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected

14:22:26 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:22:41 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected
14:22:56 ‚ùå ZeroMQ not connected (LAST)

[EA Reattached: 14:34]

14:34:00+ ‚úÖ No more errors
```

### Root Cause:
```
MT5 EA was blocked due to authentication failures.
EA stopped responding to ZeroMQ requests.
Failed attempt counter reached 5+ (g_failedAuthCount).
```

### Impact:
```
‚ùå Strategy Monitor couldn't fetch market data
‚ùå Signal generation attempted but failed
‚ùå Trade execution blocked (timeout)
‚úÖ Account polling still worked (different mechanism)
‚úÖ System remained stable
```

### Resolution:
```
‚úÖ EA reattached at 14:34
‚úÖ Authentication block reset (g_failedAuthCount = 0)
‚úÖ ZeroMQ connection restored
‚úÖ No errors since 14:34
```

### Current Status:
```
‚úÖ RESOLVED
Last 200 log lines: 0 ZeroMQ errors
Connection: STABLE
Data Fetching: WORKING
```

## üö® PROBLEM #2: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

### Details:
```
Error Message: "HTTP 500: Internal Server Error"
Service: MainController
Function: syncActiveStrategiesFromPlatform
Count: 9 errors (3 attempts x 3 retries)
Occurrence: 14:26:46 - 14:26:49
```

### Timeline:
```
14:26:46 ‚ùå Sync attempt 1 failed: HTTP 500
14:26:47 ‚ùå Sync attempt 2 failed: HTTP 500
14:26:49 ‚ùå Sync attempt 3 failed: HTTP 500
[Gave up after 3 retries]
```

### Root Cause:
```
Backend API error on web platform server.
Endpoint: /api/executor/strategies (or similar)
Possible causes:
  - Database query timeout
  - Server overload
  - Backend code issue
  - Network glitch
```

### Impact:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Active strategies not synced from platform
‚úÖ Already-running strategies continued working
‚úÖ Manual strategy commands still received via Pusher
‚úÖ System continued monitoring
‚úÖ Non-critical error (retry mechanism worked)
```

### Behavior:
```
Executor tried 3 times with exponential backoff:
  Attempt 1: Immediate
  Attempt 2: ~1 second delay
  Attempt 3: ~2 seconds delay
  After 3 failures: Gave up, continued with local state
```

### Current Status:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  MONITORING REQUIRED
Needs: Check web platform backend logs
Action: Verify /api/executor/strategies endpoint
Impact: LOW (strategies already active)
```

## üö® PROBLEM #3: Other Minor Errors

### Details:
```
Count: 2 occurrences
Nature: Miscellaneous errors
Timeline: During initialization period
Status: ‚úÖ No recurrence
```

### Examples:
```
- Port binding issues (resolved on restart)
- Temporary service initialization failures
```

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. ZeroMQ Connection (RESOLVED)
```
Status: ‚úÖ Fixed
Action: None required
Note: Monitor for recurrence
Prevention: Ensure EA stays attached
```

### 2. HTTP 500 Errors (NEEDS ATTENTION)
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Backend issue
Action: Check web platform backend logs
Check:
  - Database connection
  - API endpoint health
  - Server logs for stack traces
Priority: MEDIUM (non-critical but should investigate)
```

### 3. Monitoring Strategy
```
‚úÖ Continue using monitor scripts
‚úÖ Check logs periodically
‚úÖ Watch for new error patterns
‚ö†Ô∏è  Alert if ZeroMQ errors return
‚ö†Ô∏è  Alert if HTTP 500 persists
```

### 4. Preventive Measures
```
1. Keep EA attached to chart
2. Ensure AutoTrading enabled
3. Monitor shared secret validity
4. Check MT5 connection health
5. Verify web platform backend uptime
```

## üìã ERROR PREVENTION CHECKLIST

### Before Trading Session:
```
‚òê Check MT5 EA is attached
‚òê Verify EA shows "‚úÖ Shared secret configured"
‚òê Confirm AutoTrading is enabled
‚òê Test PING command (web ‚Üí executor ‚Üí EA)
‚òê Verify Windows Executor shows no errors
‚òê Check all services are connected
```

### During Trading:
```
‚òê Monitor logs for new errors
‚òê Watch ZeroMQ connection status
‚òê Check strategy monitor is running
‚òê Verify trades execute successfully
‚òê Monitor memory usage
```

### After Issue Detection:
```
‚òê Check error.log for details
‚òê Verify EA is still running
‚òê Test ZeroMQ connection (PING)
‚òê Restart EA if needed (remove & reattach)
‚òê Restart Windows Executor if needed
‚òê Clear config if authentication issues persist
```

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If ZeroMQ Errors Return:
```
1. Check MT5 Experts tab for EA errors
2. Verify InpSharedSecret is correct
3. Send test PING command
4. Restart EA if needed (remove & reattach)
5. Check Windows Executor logs
6. Verify port 5555/5556 not blocked
```

### If HTTP 500 Persists:
```
1. Check web platform is accessible
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Report to backend team
5. Review API endpoint logs
6. Check database connection
```

### If Trade Execution Fails:
```
1. Verify EA is running
2. Check AutoTrading enabled
3. Test PING command
4. Check account balance/margin
5. Verify symbol is tradeable
6. Check trading hours
```
